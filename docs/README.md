# Plaque Image Generator
This project uses the gh-pages package for deployment to GitHub Pages:

1. Make sure your repository is set up for GitHub Pages:
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to "Pages"
   - Set the source to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select the "gh-pages" branch and save

2. To deploy your changes:
   ```bash
   # Deploy to GitHub Pages
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. This will create or update the gh-pages branch with your current code and push it to GitHub.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (with Tailwind classes)
- JavaScript

## Development
This is a simple static HTML/CSS/JavaScript application. To run it locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the local server
npm start
```
Then open your browser to http://localhost:8000

# Apology
The code is pretty sketchy, not entirely robust and the generation of the images is hardcoded in script.js.

Please do not make assumptions about my coding ability based on this repository ðŸ˜‚.  I promise I'm better at this when it's my job.

Feel free to make improvements but, for now, it works.
